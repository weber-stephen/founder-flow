# Strategic Plan for InsightRetain (AI-Powered Article Summaries & Insights)

## 1. Opportunity Clarification

- Reframed Idea:  
  A lean AI tool that converts articles into concise summaries while capturing and organizing key insights, making it easier for busy individuals to handle large volumes of reading and quickly recall vital information.

- Key Features/Benefits:  
  1. Rapid Article Summaries: Automate the process of breaking down long-form content into digestible highlights.  
  2. Organized Insights Retention: Store essential points in a structured knowledge base for quick retrieval.  
  3. Seamless Workflow Integration: Provide a lightweight interface that integrates with common reading/research tools.

- Potential Target Markets:  
  1. Mid-Level Managers and Executives who deal with an overload of reports and articles.  
  2. Academic Researchers and Students looking to speed up literature reviews.

- Core Value Proposition:  
  “Save time and increase retention by automating article summaries and storing key insights in one central hub.”

## 2. Strategic Goal

Validate the market demand by launching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in four weeks with automatic summarization, insights retention, and a simple user interface. Aim to gather at least 30 active users who provide constructive feedback on usability and core features.
