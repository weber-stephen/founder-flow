- **Weeks 3–4**:  
  - Refine UI, gather feedback from pilot users.  
  - Fix bugs, improve summarization accuracy.  
  - Aim for early sign-ups and usage tracking.

## 6. Feedback Collection Plan
- In-app feedback form to capture immediate user reactions.  
- Short weekly user interviews (3–5 participants) to refine user experience.
