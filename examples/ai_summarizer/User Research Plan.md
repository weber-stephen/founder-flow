# User Research Plan for InsightFocus AI

## 1. Lean Interview Questions

<mvp_planning>
- Analyze the key aspects of the problem or product idea.
- Brainstorm questions that will reveal:
  a. Problem frequency and reality.
  b. Current solutions users employ.
  c. Problem urgency and pain level.
  d. Willingness to adopt or pay for a new solution.
- Ensure questions are open-ended and non-leading.
- Review and refine questions to ensure they're concise and impactful.
- Consider how each question aligns with the MVP goals and resource constraints.
</mvp_planning>

1. How often do you find yourself overwhelmed by the amount of information you need to read and retain?
2. What methods or tools do you currently use to manage and retain insights from articles?
3. Can you describe a recent situation where you struggled to recall important information from an article?
4. How urgent is the need for a tool that summarizes and retains insights for you?
5. What features would you find most valuable in a tool designed to help with information overload?
6. Would you be willing to try a new tool that offers these features? Why or why not?
7. What would make you consider paying for a tool that helps with summarization and insights retention?

## 2. Simulated User Interviews and Feedback Summary

<mvp_planning>
- Create 3-5 diverse user profiles based on the target market.
- For each profile, consider their background, goals, and pain points.
- Simulate their responses to the interview questions, keeping in mind their unique perspectives.
- Identify common themes across interviews.
- Note unexpected insights or outliers that could impact the MVP.
- Prioritize feedback that directly relates to core MVP features.
- Consider how the feedback might influence resource allocation for the MVP.
</mvp_planning>

### User Profiles and Feedback

**Profile 1: Busy Professional (Consultant)**
- **Background:** Works with multiple clients, constantly reading industry reports.
- **Feedback:** Often overwhelmed by the volume of reading. Uses manual note-taking but finds it inefficient. Urgent need for a tool that saves time. Would pay for a reliable solution.

**Profile 2: Academic Researcher (PhD Student)**
- **Background:** Conducts literature reviews, reads numerous academic papers.
- **Feedback:** Struggles with retaining key insights from papers. Uses digital tools but finds them lacking in retention capabilities. Very interested in a tool that offers both summarization and retention.

**Profile 3: Tech-Savvy Enthusiast**
- **Background:** Keeps up with tech trends, reads articles daily.
- **Feedback:** Uses a mix of apps but finds them fragmented. Would like a seamless integration. Open to trying new solutions if they offer significant improvements.

**Common Themes:**
- Overwhelming volume of reading material.
- Inefficiency in current methods of summarization and retention.
- High interest in a tool that combines both features.
- Willingness to pay for a comprehensive solution.

## 3. Key Hypotheses to Validate

<mvp_planning>
- Review the interview feedback and identify recurring themes.
- Extract the most critical assumptions that could impact MVP success.
- Frame each hypothesis in a testable format (If..., then...).
- Prioritize hypotheses based on:
  a. Potential impact on MVP success.
  b. Ease of testing with limited resources.
  c. Alignment with core product features.
- Consider how each hypothesis might influence MVP development decisions.
</mvp_planning>

1. If users are overwhelmed by reading volume, then they will adopt a tool that offers automated summarization.
2. If current methods are inefficient, then users will prefer a tool that integrates summarization and retention.
3. If users are willing to pay for a comprehensive solution, then a freemium model with premium features will be viable.

## 4. Cold Outreach Template

<mvp_planning>
- Identify the key elements needed in an effective outreach message.
- Craft a brief, engaging opening that quickly captures attention.
- Clearly state the purpose of the outreach.
- Highlight specific benefits for the potential user in participating.
- Include a clear, low-friction call-to-action.
- Ensure the template is adaptable for various platforms (email, social media, etc.).
- Review the message to ensure it aligns with the startup's brand and MVP goals.
