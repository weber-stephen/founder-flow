# User Research Agent Plan for MVP Launch

## 1. Draft 5â€“7 Lean Interview Questions
<mvp_planning>
- Focus on understanding the frequency and reality of the problem, current solutions, urgency, and willingness to adopt/pay for a new solution.
- Ensure questions are open-ended, non-leading, and concise.
- Align questions with MVP goals and resource constraints.
</mvp_planning>

1. Can you describe your current process for creating Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face when tracking assumptions during product development?
3. How do you currently develop and update user personas, and what difficulties do you encounter?
4. How urgent is the need to streamline your documentation process, and why?
5. What tools or methods do you currently use to manage product documentation, and how effective are they?
6. Would you be open to trying a new tool that automates PRD creation and persona development? Why or why not?
7. How much would you be willing to invest in a solution that significantly reduces your documentation workload?

## 2. Simulate User Interviews and Summarize Feedback
<mvp_planning>
- Create diverse user profiles based on the target market.
- Simulate responses considering each profile's background, goals, and pain points.
- Identify common themes and unexpected insights.
- Prioritize feedback related to core MVP features.
</mvp_planning>

### Simulated User Profiles and Feedback

**Profile 1: Early-Stage Startup PM**
- **Background:** Works in a team of 10, juggling multiple roles.
- **Feedback:** "Creating PRDs is time-consuming and often inconsistent. We use Google Docs, but it's not ideal for tracking changes or assumptions. A tool that automates this would be a game-changer."

**Profile 2: Mid-Sized SaaS Company PM**
- **Background:** Manages a team of 50, with dedicated roles for documentation.
- **Feedback:** "We have a system in place, but it's cumbersome. Tracking assumptions is a manual process, and personas are often outdated. Automation could save us significant time."

**Profile 3: Internal Product Team Lead**
- **Background:** Works in a large enterprise with established processes.
- **Feedback:** "Our documentation is thorough but slow. There's a lot of back-and-forth. A tool that speeds up PRD creation and keeps personas current would be valuable."

### Common Themes
- **Time-Consuming Processes:** All profiles highlighted the time and effort required for documentation.
- **Inconsistent Documentation:** A lack of standardization was a recurring issue.
- **Interest in Automation:** There was a strong interest in tools that could automate and streamline processes.

### Unexpected Insights
- **Resistance to Change:** Some users expressed concern about integrating new tools into existing workflows.
- **Desire for Customization:** Users want tools that can be tailored to their specific needs.

## 3. Summarize Key Hypotheses to Validate
<mvp_planning>
- Identify recurring themes from feedback.
- Frame hypotheses in a testable format.
- Prioritize based on impact, ease of testing, and alignment with core features.
</mvp_planning>

1. **If** product managers have access to an automated PRD tool, **then** they will save at least 30% of their time on documentation tasks.
2. **If** assumption tracking is centralized and automated, **then** product teams will experience fewer miscommunications and errors.
3. **If** personas are automatically updated based on user data, **then** product decisions will better align with customer needs.

## 4. Provide a Short Template for Cold Outreach
<mvp_planning>
- Craft an engaging opening and clear purpose.
- Highlight benefits and include a low-friction call-to-action.
- Ensure adaptability for various platforms.
