# MVP Plan

## 1. Pain Points and Core Problem
- Manual, time-consuming product documentation.  
- Need for automation that integrates smoothly into existing workflows.  
- Concern over data security and customization, especially in larger organizations.

## 2. Minimum Viable Feature Set
- PRD Generator that creates standardized documents from basic inputs.  
- Assumption Log for recording and validating product assumptions.  
- Persona Builder for generating core persona attributes and goals.

## 3. User Stories
1. “As a startup PM, I can generate a PRD quickly to focus on bigger strategic tasks.”
